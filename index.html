<h2>A Super Mega Accurate Definitive Season Preview</h2>

<figure><img src="photo-via-mlb.png"/></figure>

<p><strong>By Paul Moses</strong></p>

<p>It’s good to be back!! I missed you guys. Great draft, great to see everyone, stoked to have a more normal season this year. Since we’re all keeping the same rosters all season and projections are infallible this preview is definitely useful and accurate!</p>

<p>I used THE BAT X projections, which incorporate some Statcast data and may be familiar to DFS players (or not idk much about DFS). I didn’t try to project lineups, just ran every player who had a meaningful playing time projection; apologies to Seth Beer, Adley Rutschman, Bobby Witt Jr, etc. Rosters as of 3/26 with a couple adjustments for major injuries.</p>

<p>Full projection sheets can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YWlD2pBwF1-eUqDu9mECmHfDq5JnoVKLX3CEnVO9_48/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h3>TIER 1: MASHERS</h3>

<h4>Baby Bombers (86)</h4>

<p>Bombers’ offensive projection is fueled in part by pure volume, but take a couple fringe bats off and this is probably still the best offense in the league. It’s fine though, it’s not like they’re all established, prime or early prime, with Wander Franco on the way. I’m sure we can all catch him if we just nail our next draft.</p>

<p>A note on Wander: projections notoriously hate rookies, but THE BAT X has him at .288/.348/.447, 20% above league average, as a just turned 20 y/o with no experience above high A. unreal. </p>

<p>If Bombers disappoint it will likely be on the pitching side, where there aren’t many innings and a number of low-floor arms. In a perfect world quality wins out over quantity and gets the offense across the line most weeks, but there are plenty of scenarios where this staff needs some repair from the waiver wire to make it through the year.</p>

<h4>Beane Drip (85.5)</h4>

<p>Beaners have a real shot at being the best team in the league (again) as Trout and Yelich return to form over a full season. The pitching projection probably undersells the talent in this department, as late round stashes Casey Mize and John Means really drag down the staff ratios. The core of this team is starting to age a little bit, and the next generation doesn’t sparkle quite like the current one, but these guys likely still have a couple years of title contention left in the tank.</p>

<h4>Giant BALLS (85)</h4>

<p>BALLS made a big push for this season in the period surrounding the draft, and here he is. His best bats are likely done improving but damn are they good. Despite a solid projection, the challenges will likely come on the pitching side, where we see the oldest and most fragile staff in the league. Juggling roster and DL spots may be tricky through the season, and there’s a chance half these guys are gone by season’s end. But if Sale/Scherzer/Strasburg/Paxton are healthy for the playoffs, look out.</p>

<h3>TIER 2: DARK HORSES</h3>

<h4>Stick Talk (80.5)</h4>

<p>The Work Stick Talk did on their pitching staff really shows through in the projection, and they’re a bullpen arm away from having one of the more complete staffs in the league. The offense took a hit with the loss of Kyle Tucker, but Mancini was an inspired late pick and guys like Moncada and Robert have a lot of upside to beat their projections as well. A couple breakout seasons and/or a solid waiver bat could have Stick Talk pushing for a title.</p>

<h4>Chapmandu (80.5)</h4>

<p>Chapmandu punted steals but are built to win now with an aging balanced squad possessing top tier contact and plate discipline, second tier power, deGrom, and a lights out bullpen. This foundation allowed them to take some shots on wildcards (hi Shohei!) that could easily push them into title contention. The playoffs this year should be NUTS.</p>

<h4>Acuna Matata (75.5)</h4>

<p>This pitching staff, man. It’s gonna beat most of us most weeks, and the comparably thin lineup doesn’t have to do a whole lot to push them over the line. Matata should probably be targeting some power bats on waivers but I don’t think this is a team any of us want to face head to head. You never know when Mondesi Week is coming for you.</p>

<h3>TIER 3: PLAYOFFS!?</h3>

<h4>Raw Doggin Randos (69.5)</h4>

<p>Randos go heavy on pitching and speed, with a killer bullpen that was so painstakingly drafted, but are going to struggle to match their opponents in at bats and innings as currently constructed. Without some tinkering, it will be another year of aging stars suffering through young teammates’ growing pains. Young rosters do have upside well beyond the projected outcomes though, so a few young players popping and/or contributing ahead of schedule could be enough to push the Randos into a playoff spot.</p>

<h4>Tub Bublers (61)</h4>

<p>Bublers have a killer bullpen, SP depth, and some good hitters, but with Arenado leaving Coors the projections think they are missing the centerpiece all-around bat to tie it together. Picking up a speedster on the wire could be a quick boost to a lagging category, or perhaps punting average and taking on some swing and miss sluggers. We know they’re not afraid to tinker, and they’ve got a real foundation to build off of.</p>

<h3>TIER 4: RIP UR TEAM BRO</h3>

<h4>Mutilation Engineers (52)</h4>

<p>Apologies to Mutilation Engineers, the first team this year to catch a nasty injury bug. Keeping a competitive roster without letting go of injured talent may be a challenge, but there’s a lot of empty space to fill on this roster and there are superstars on waivers every year. It’s definitely possible for Engineers to tread water until their guys start coming back and make a late season run. Whether they can do so while holding onto prized prospect Seth Beer remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>TIER 5: OH… OH NO</h3>

<h4>Sound the Bells (37.5)</h4>

<p>Projections rarely predict breakouts from young players but all the same, ouch. Guess I should hold on to my first round pick, and accept that the rest of my lineup doesn&#39;t have the juice to carry Miguel Sano’s whiffs.</p>
